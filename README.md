## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented software developer with hands-on experience building web and mobile applications. I recently completed a full-stack development internship where I worked on real-world projects using **ASP.NET Core**, **Vue.js**, and **SQL Server**, and I’ve also built several mobile apps with **Flutter** and **Dart** as part of my academic projects.

I'm excited about clean UI, scalable backend systems, and continuous learning. Currently exploring **TypeScript** and refreshing my **PHP/Laravel** fundamentals.
